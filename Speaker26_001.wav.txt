 and roots pulled up from the hedgerow, the town mouse set to his friend. You live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of plenty. I am surrounded with every luxury, and if you will come with me as I much wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my dainty's. The country mouse was easily persuaded, and returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the town mouse placed before him bread, barley beans, dried figs, honey, raisins, and last of all brought a dainty piece of cheese from the basket. The country mouse being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms, and lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat, someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking as fast as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it.
