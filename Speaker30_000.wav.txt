Starting by David Wales, around the You Log by Willis Boyd Allen, Story 1, around the You Log. It is the waning of the year, as the twilight often hastened by the soft blur of falling snow, encroaches more and more upon the brief day, we gather closely about our firesides and their heart to heart, or want to listen as at no other period of this perseic 19th century life, two tales of old and times. More than ever are we drawn together at the season of our Savior's birth, when the You Log glows a mane and the sweet spirit of Christmas kindles within us, a warmth and gladness that responds to the cheerful blaze upon the heart.
